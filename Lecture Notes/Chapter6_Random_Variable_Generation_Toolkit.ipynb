    "\n",
    "### 🤔 What is an LCG?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Linear Congruential Generator** is the simplest way to generate pseudorandom numbers. It uses a simple formula to create a sequence of integers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_i = (a \\cdot u_{i-1} + b) \\mod M$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breaking it down:**\n",
    "- **uᵢ**: The current random number\n",
    "- **uᵢ₋₁**: The previous random number\n",
    "- **a**: Multiplier (a constant we choose)\n",
    "- **b**: Increment (another constant we choose)\n",
    "- **M**: Modulus (defines the range: 0 to M-1)\n",
    "- **mod M**: Take remainder after dividing by M\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like a clock:** If M=12 (like a clock), and you start at 3, then do (5×3 + 1) = 16, you get 16 mod 12 = 4. The next number depends only on the current number—it's deterministic but looks random!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:** The sequence will eventually repeat (cycle back to where it started). The length of this cycle is called the **period**. A good LCG should have a long period (ideally M, the maximum possible).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 LCG Recurrence Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_i = (a \\cdot u_{i-1} + b) \\mod M$$\n",
