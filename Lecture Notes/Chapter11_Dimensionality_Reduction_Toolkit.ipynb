    "## 11.2 Understanding SVD: The Foundation of Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is SVD?\n",
    "\n",
    "For any matrix $A$ (size $n \\times m$), the **Singular Value Decomposition** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = U \\Sigma V^T\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $U$ is $n \\times n$ (left singular vectors) - orthonormal columns\n",
    "- $\\Sigma$ is $n \\times m$ (diagonal singular values) - $\\sigma_1 \\geq \\sigma_2 \\geq \\cdots \\geq 0$\n",
    "- $V$ is $m \\times m$ (right singular vectors) - orthonormal columns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Geometric Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of $A$ as a linear transformation:\n",
    "1. $V^T$ rotates the input space (change of coordinates)\n",
    "2. $\\Sigma$ scales along new axes (stretching)\n",
    "3. $U$ rotates the result (final orientation)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **singular values** $\\sigma_i$ tell us how much $A$ stretches along each direction!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connection to Eigenvalues (Lemma 11.7)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the KEY insight connecting SVD to eigenvalue problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding the First Singular Vector\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the **first singular vector** as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v_1 = \\arg\\max_{\\|v\\|=1} \\|A v\\|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the direction where $A$ stretches the most! And the stretch amount is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma_1 = \\|A v_1\\|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Lemma 11.7: The Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lemma 11.7** tells us that:\n",
    "1. $v_1$ is the **top eigenvector** of $A^T A$ (with eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$)\n",
    "2. $\\sigma_1 = \\sqrt{\\lambda_1}$ (singular value = square root of eigenvalue!)\n",
    "3. The left singular vector is $u_1 = \\frac{A v_1}{\\sigma_1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compute SVD by finding eigenvectors of $A^T A$ (or $AA^T$)!\n",
    "- Eigenvalue problem: easier to understand\n",
    "- Many algorithms available\n",
    "- Power method is the simplest\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 The Power Method: Finding Top Eigenvectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The **power method** is an iterative algorithm to find the largest eigenvector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm (for symmetric matrix $B$):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize**: Pick random vector $v^{(0)}$, normalize it\n",
    "2. **Iterate**: \n",
    "   - $w^{(t)} = B v^{(t-1)}$ (apply the matrix)\n",
    "   - $v^{(t)} = w^{(t)} / \\|w^{(t)}\\|$ (normalize)\n",
    "3. **Converge**: $v^{(t)} \\to v_1$ (top eigenvector)\n",
    "4. **Eigenvalue**: $\\lambda_1 \\approx v_1^T B v_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Any vector can be written as $v = \\sum c_i v_i$ (sum of eigenvectors).  \n",
    "After $t$ iterations:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "B^t v = \\sum c_i \\lambda_i^t v_i = \\lambda_1^t \\left( c_1 v_1 + \\sum_{i>1} c_i \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_i}{\\lambda_1}\\right)^t v_i \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $|\\lambda_i/\\lambda_1| < 1$ for $i > 1$, the smaller terms vanish! 🎯\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deflation: Getting Multiple Eigenvectors\n",
    "\n",
    "To find $k$ eigenvectors:\n",
    "1. Find $v_1$ using power method\n",
    "2. **Deflate**: $B \\leftarrow B - \\lambda_1 v_1 v_1^T$ (remove the top component)\n",
    "3. Repeat for $v_2, v_3, \\ldots, v_k$\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you have data in 3D, but it lies mostly on a 2D plane. PCA finds that plane automatically!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Three Ways to Think About PCA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variance Maximization**: Find directions with maximum spread\n",
    "   - \"Where is the data most spread out?\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Project onto lower dimensions\n",
    "   - \"What's the best k-dimensional view of d-dimensional data?\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Reconstruction**: Minimize error when compressing and decompressing\n",
    "   - \"How can we compress data with minimal information loss?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "All three perspectives give the **same answer**: use singular vectors of the centered data!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Mathematics: PCA = SVD of Centered Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Center the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why center?** PCA finds directions of maximum variance *around the mean*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given data matrix $X$ (size $n \\times d$), compute:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\n",

    "### Step 2: Compute SVD\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_{\\text{centered}} = U \\Sigma V^T\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: The PCA Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **principal components** are the columns of $V$ (right singular vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "To transform data to PCA coordinates:\n",

    "1. Center: $X_c = X - \\bar{x}$\n",
    "2. Project: $Z = X_c V_k$ (use first $k$ principal components)\n",
    "3. Result: $Z$ has $k$ columns instead of $d$ (compression!)\n",

    "### Inverse Transform (Reconstruct):\n",

    "3. Result: $X'$ is the best rank-$k$ approximation of $X$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Trade-off:\n",
    "- Larger $k$ → better reconstruction, less compression\n",

    "## 11.4.3 Application: Anomaly Detection via Reconstruction Error 🔍\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normal data** lies in a low-dimensional subspace. **Anomalies** don't!\n",
    "\n",
    "If we compress \"normal\" data to $k$ dimensions and reconstruct it, the error is small.  \n",
    "But anomalies have large reconstruction error because they don't fit the pattern!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 The Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Phase** (on normal data):\n",
    "1. Fit PCA with $k$ components to capture \"normal\" patterns\n",
    "2. Reconstruct training data and compute reconstruction errors\n",
    "3. Set threshold $\\tau$ = high quantile of training errors (e.g., 99th percentile)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing Phase** (on new data):\n",
    "1. Transform test point to PCA space and back\n",
    "2. Compute reconstruction error $e = \\|x - \\hat{x}\\|$\n",
    "3. Flag as anomaly if $e > \\tau$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of PCA as learning the \"shape\" of normal data:\n",
    "- Normal points: fit the shape well → small reconstruction error\n",
    "- Anomalies: don't fit the shape → large reconstruction error\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**k (number of components)**:\n",
    "- Too small: can't capture normal patterns → false positives\n",
    "- Too large: captures noise → false negatives\n",
    "- Rule of thumb: choose k to explain 90-95% of variance\n",
    "\n",
    "**q (threshold quantile)**:\n",
    "- Typical: q = 0.95 or 0.99\n",
    "- Higher q = fewer false alarms but may miss some anomalies\n",
    "- Lower q = more sensitive but more false alarms\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ When This Works Well\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Normal data has low intrinsic dimension  \n",
    "✓ Anomalies are different from normal patterns  \n",
    "✓ You have clean training data (mostly normal examples)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "✗ If anomalies also lie in the low-D subspace (systematic drift)  \n",
    "✗ If normal data is very high-dimensional with no structure  \n",
    "✗ If training data contains many anomalies (contaminates the model)  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Means (Intuition):\n",

    "1. **Operator norm**: $\\|\\cdot\\|_2$ measures the largest eigenvalue deviation\n",
    "2. **Exponential concentration**: Probability decreases exponentially with $n$!\n",
    "3. **Dependence on d**: Factor $2d$ means we need $n \\gtrsim d \\log d$ samples\n",
    "4. **Boundedness C**: Must have bounded samples (or sub-Gaussian tails)\n",

    "### Practical Implications:\n",

    "\n",
    "The **excess risk** measures the price of using finite samples:\n",

    "E_k = R(\\hat{\\Pi}_k^*) - R(\\Pi_k^*)\n",
    "$$\n",

    "3. **Exponential concentration**: Probability of large excess risk drops exponentially with $n$!\n",

    "### Practical Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Rule of thumb**: Want $n \\geq 10 \\cdot d \\cdot k$ for reliable PCA  \n",

    "## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Forgetting to Center Data**\n",
    "❌ Running PCA on non-centered data  \n",
    "✅ Always use `center_data()` before PCA  \n",
    "**Why**: PCA finds directions of variance around the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Too Few Samples**\n",
    "❌ $n < d$ or $n < 10dk$  \n",
    "✅ Check sample complexity bounds first  \n",
    "**Why**: Covariance estimate unreliable, excess risk large\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Choosing k Arbitrarily**\n",
    "❌ \"Let's use k=10 because it's a nice number\"  \n",
    "✅ Look at explained variance ratio, scree plot, cross-validation  \n",
    "**Why**: Wrong k → either under-fitting or over-fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Scaling Issues**\n",
    "❌ Features on different scales (e.g., meters vs kilometers)  \n",
    "✅ Standardize features first: $(x - \\mu)/\\sigma$  \n",
    "**Why**: PCA is sensitive to scale\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Interpreting Components Incorrectly**\n",
    "❌ \"PC1 is the most important feature\"  \n",
    "✅ \"PC1 is the direction of maximum variance\"  \n",
    "**Why**: Components are linear combinations, not individual features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Overfitting in Anomaly Detection**\n",
    "❌ Using same data for training and threshold selection  \n",
    "✅ Split: train PCA on clean set, tune threshold on validation  \n",
    "**Why**: Avoid memorizing noise as \"normal\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Ignoring Computational Cost**\n",
    "❌ Full SVD on huge matrices  \n",
    "✅ Use randomized SVD or iterative methods for large scale  \n",
    "**Why**: Full SVD is $O(nd^2)$ — too slow for big data\n",
