    "\n",
    "## 📚 What are Markov Chains?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Markov chain** is a mathematical model that describes a sequence of events where the probability of each event depends **only on the state of the previous event**, not on the entire history. This is called the **Markov property** or \"memorylessness.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Real-World Examples:\n",
    "- **Weather**: Tomorrow's weather depends mainly on today's weather, not last week's\n",
    "- **Stock prices**: Tomorrow's price movements depend on today's price\n",
    "- **Web browsing**: The next page you visit depends on your current page (basis of Google's PageRank!)\n",
    "- **Text generation**: The next word depends on the current word (simple language models)\n",
    "- **Games**: Moving between game states based on current position\n",

    "## 0) Core Helpers: Understanding Transition Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 What is a Transition Matrix?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **transition matrix** `P` encodes the probabilities of moving between states in a Markov chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:**\n",
    "- `P` is a square matrix of size `k × k` (where `k` = number of states)\n",
    "- Entry `P[i,j]` = probability of moving from state `i` to state `j` in one step\n",
    "- States are typically numbered `0, 1, 2, ..., k-1`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** 3-state weather model (Sunny=0, Cloudy=1, Rainy=2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "       To: S    C    R\n",
    "From S:  [0.7  0.2  0.1]   ← If sunny today, 70% chance sunny tomorrow\n",
    "From C:  [0.3  0.4  0.3]   ← If cloudy today, 40% chance cloudy tomorrow  \n",
    "From R:  [0.2  0.3  0.5]   ← If rainy today, 50% chance rainy tomorrow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📏 The Row-Stochastic Property\n",
    "\n",
    "For `P` to be a valid transition matrix, it must be **row-stochastic**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-negative entries:** `P[i,j] ≥ 0` (probabilities can't be negative!)\n",
    "2. **Rows sum to 1:** `Σⱼ P[i,j] = 1` (from any state, total probability must be 100%)\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes sense: from state `i`, you must go *somewhere* with total probability 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Why Validate?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using a matrix as `P`, we must ensure it's row-stochastic:\n",
    "- **Normalization errors:** Floating-point arithmetic can cause small deviations\n",
    "- **User input errors:** Manually entered matrices might have mistakes\n",
    "- **Construction bugs:** Programmatically built matrices might have logical errors\n",

    "\n",
    "Basic random walks on graphs can have issues:\n",

    "### 💡 Solution: Random Surfer with Teleportation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **random surfer model** blends two behaviors:\n",
