    "## Some general hints and information:\n",
    "* Try to answer all questions even if you are uncertain.\n",
    "* Comment your code, so that if you get the wrong answer I can understand how you thought\n",
    "this can give you some points even though the code does not run.\n",
    "* Follow the instruction sheet rigorously.\n",
    "* This exam is partially autograded, but your code and your free text answers are manually graded anonymously.\n",
    "* If there are any questions, please ask the exam guards, they will escalate it to me if necessary.\n",
    "* I (Benny) will visit the exam room at around 10:30 to see if there are any questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for free text answers\n",
    "* Be VERY clear with your reasoning, there should be zero ambiguity in what you are referring to.\n",
    "* If you want to include math, you can write LaTeX in the Markdown cells, for instance `$f(x)=x^2$` will be rendered as $f(x)=x^2$ and `$$f(x) = x^2$$` will become an equation line, as follows\n",
    "$$f(x) = x^2$$\n",

    "\n",
    "**Purpose of this visualization:**\n",
    "This plot reveals the relationship between what the model predicts and what actually occurs in the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to interpret:**\n",
    "1. **Perfect prediction line (red dashed)**: $y = x$ line where predicted equals actual\n",
    "2. **Points near the line**: Good predictions\n",
    "3. **Points far from the line**: Large prediction errors\n",

    "**Key patterns to look for:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Systematic bias:**\n",
    "- Points **above the line**: Model consistently **underpredicts** (predicts too low)\n",
    "- Points **below the line**: Model consistently **overpredicts** (predicts too high)\n",
    "- Points **on both sides**: Balanced errors (no systematic bias)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spread/variance:**\n",
    "- **Tight cluster** around line: Low prediction variance, good model\n",

    "The Value of MAE is 1.629, lower than a dummy model (that always predict mean of the training data) and have a Normalized MAE of 0.1647. It's an alright prediction, but there could be another model that could give a better performance.\n",

    "MAE of the training data is around 1.6055, indicating that the model might be underfitting and the performance can be improved by using a more complex model.\n",

    "#### Discussion on the predicted vs. true scatterplot\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the plot, the model are able to generalize the problem on some sense. However, we can see that there're quite significant gap between the scatter against the perfect line (where Predicted = True), indicating that other model might be able to perform better. \n",

    "\n",
    "Based on the results, Linear Regression gave a moderate result that albeit better than baseline model, probably isn't the best to fit the problem. The Plot shows systematic bias: low ring counts are frequently overestimated (points below the identity line) while high ring counts are frequently underestimated (points above the line). \n",
    "\n",
    "Predictions are concentrated around mid-range values, indicating underfitting/high bias. This suggests the model may be too simple to capture nonlinear relationships or feature interactions, so a more flexible model (e.g., tree-based ensembles or nonlinear regression) could potentially improve performance. \n"

    "#### What features are reasonable?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasonable features are patient characteristics that exist **before** the physician visits occur. I selected 15 features grouped into:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Health Status** (4 features): `exclhlth`, `poorhealth`, `numchron`, `adldiff` - These directly indicate health needs\n",
    "2. **Demographics** (4 features): `age`, `male`, `married`, `school` - Age and education affect health behavior\n",
    "3. **Geographic** (3 features): `noreast`, `midwest`, `west` - Regional healthcare access differences\n",
    "4. **Socioeconomic** (2 features): `faminc`, `employed` - Income affects healthcare utilization\n",
    "5. **Insurance** (2 features): `privins`, `medicaid` - Coverage enables access to physicians\n",
    "\n",
    "**Excluded variables** (data leakage): `ofnp`, `opp`, `opnp`, `emr`, `hosp` - These are other healthcare utilization outcomes that occur concurrently with physician visits. Using them would be cheating since they're not predictive characteristics but outcomes themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In regards to how much data we have, how many features do you think we should aim for?\n",
    "\n",
    "With 15 features selected, we should have at least 150-300 samples (10-20 samples per feature) for reliable Poisson regression. Since this is healthcare data from a real organization, we likely have thousands of patient records, making 15 features reasonable. Too many features (>20) could lead to overfitting, while too few (<10) might miss important predictors. Our 15 features balance comprehensiveness with parsimony.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What other features would you like to have used but was not collected?\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional useful features not in this dataset:\n",
    "- **Medical history**: Previous diagnosis codes, medication counts, hospitalization history\n",
    "- **Distance to healthcare**: Miles to nearest physician office (access barrier)\n",
    "- **Health behaviors**: Smoking status, BMI, exercise frequency\n",
    "- **Provider characteristics**: Whether patient has established primary care physician\n",
    "- **Comorbidity index**: Charlson score or similar composite health measure\n",
    "- **Mental health**: Depression/anxiety diagnoses (increase utilization)\n",
    "- **Social support**: Living alone vs with family (affects care-seeking)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature selection prioritizes **pre-existing patient characteristics** over **concurrent healthcare outcomes** to avoid data leakage. The 15 selected features capture health needs (chronic conditions, health status), access enablers (insurance, income), and demographic factors (age, region) that are established predictors of physician visit frequency in health services research. This selection balances predictive power with the fundamental requirement that features must be knowable before the outcome occurs.\n"
