    "\n",
    "**Example:** If we saw state 0 five times, and three times it went to state 1:\n",

    "\n",

    "1. Find eigenvector of P^T with eigenvalue 1\n",
    "2. Normalize so it sums to 1\n",

    "#### Task 1.4: Simulating the Chain\n",

    "```\n",
    "Start at state s₀\n",

    "2. For each run, count steps until you hit state j\n",
    "3. Average all these counts\n",
    "4. ✅ Simple, intuitive, works for any chain\n",
    "5. ⚠️ Approximate (depends on number of simulations)\n",

    "**Method B: Analytical (Linear Equations)**\n",
    "The hitting time h_i satisfies:\n",
    "- h_j = 0 (already at target)\n",
    "- h_i = 1 + Σ_k P[i,k] × h_k for i ≠ j\n",
    "\n",
    "This forms a system of linear equations: **(I - P)h = 1** with constraint h_j = 0\n",

    "Solve using: `np.linalg.solve(A, b)`\n",

    "✅ Exact solution (within numerical precision)\n",
    "✅ Validates simulation results\n",
    "⚠️ Requires solving linear system (can be slow for huge chains)\n",

    "**Comparison:**\n",
    "Both methods should give nearly identical results! If they differ significantly, there's a bug.\n",

    "#### Expected Results:\n",
    "When you run `problem1_main()`, you should see:\n",
    "- ✅ A 4×4 transition matrix with rows summing to 1\n",
    "- ✅ Validation confirming it's a proper transition matrix\n",
    "- ✅ Hitting times from state 0 to all other states\n",

    "- A classifier that says \"everything is legitimate\" is also 99% accurate!\n",
    "- But it catches ZERO fraud - completely useless!\n",

    "| OK (0) | Fraud (1) | False Negative (FN) | **$500** | 💥 Missed fraud! Lost money! |\n",

    "#### Task 2.1: Train/Test Split and SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why split data?**\n",
    "- **Training set (80%):** Teach the model patterns\n",
    "- **Test set (20%):** Evaluate how well it generalizes to new data\n",
    "- Never test on training data - that's cheating! (like studying the exact exam questions)\n",

    "- Works well with clear margin of separation\n",
    "- LinearSVC is fast for large datasets\n",

    "**The Process:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Split data → train (80%) + test (20%)\n",

    "2. For each threshold, compute total cost\n",
    "3. Pick the threshold with minimum cost!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does it work?**\n",
    "Since FN costs 5× more than FP, we should be **more aggressive** in flagging fraud. The optimal threshold shifts to catch more fraud, even if it means more false alarms.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Key Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SVM Decision Function:** Returns a score (not calibrated probability), but that's OK!\n",
    "   - We only need relative ordering: higher score = more likely fraud\n",
    "   - Threshold optimization works on any monotonic transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cost Asymmetry Drives Strategy:**\n",
    "   - If FN and FP cost the same → threshold = 0.5 (or 0 for SVM)\n",
    "   - If FN costs more → lower threshold (catch more fraud)\n",
    "   - If FP costs more → higher threshold (avoid false alarms)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Real-World Impact:**\n",
    "   - 46% cost reduction from simple threshold tuning!\n",
    "   - No need to retrain model\n",
    "   - Easy to implement in production\n",

    "- ✅ Optimal threshold around -0.4 (more aggressive than default 0)\n",

    "#### When to Use Hoeffding?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Hoeffding when:**\n",
    "✅ You need **guaranteed** bounds (no assumptions)\n",
    "✅ You have **bounded** random variables\n",
    "✅ Sample size is **moderate to large**\n",
    "✅ You want **worst-case** guarantees (risk-averse)\n",
    "✅ You don't know the distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't use Hoeffding when:**\n",
    "❌ You know the distribution (use CLT instead)\n",
    "❌ You need **tight** intervals (use bootstrap or CLT)\n",
    "❌ You have **unbounded** variables\n",
    "❌ Sample size is very small (all methods fail)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternative Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Central Limit Theorem (CLT):**\n",
    "- Assumes: large n, finite variance\n",
    "- Formula: CI = [mean ± z × SE], where SE = std/√n\n",
    "- ✅ Tighter intervals\n",
    "- ⚠️ Assumes approximate normality\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Bootstrap:**\n",
    "- Resample data many times\n",
    "- Compute empirical percentiles\n",
    "- ✅ Uses actual data distribution\n",
    "- ✅ No assumptions\n",
    "- ⚠️ Computationally intensive\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Bernstein's Inequality:**\n",
    "- Like Hoeffding but uses variance\n",
    "- ✅ Tighter than Hoeffding\n",
    "- ⚠️ Requires computing variance\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to Get Tighter Intervals?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1: Collect more data**\n",
    "- Width ∝ 1/√n\n",
    "- 4× more data → 2× tighter interval\n",
    "- 100× more data → 10× tighter interval\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- n = 600 → ε ≈ 27.72\n",
    "- n = 2,400 → ε ≈ 13.86 (half the width!)\n",
    "- n = 60,000 → ε ≈ 2.77 (10× tighter!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2: Use distributional information**\n",
    "With CLT (assuming normality):\n",
    "```\n",
    "SE = std/√n ≈ 25/√600 ≈ 1.02\n",
    "CI = [13.33 ± 1.96×1.02] = [11.33, 15.33]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Much tighter! But requires assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 3: Bootstrap (empirical)**\n",
    "- Resample test set 10,000 times\n",
    "- Compute cost for each resample\n",
    "- Take 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles\n",
    "- No assumptions, uses actual distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always report uncertainty**\n",
    "   - Point estimate alone is incomplete\n",
    "   - CI shows reliability of estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hoeffding = Conservative but guaranteed**\n",
    "   - Works for any bounded distribution\n",
    "   - No assumptions needed\n",
    "   - Price: wider intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Trade-offs everywhere**\n",
    "   - Guaranteed validity ↔ Tight intervals\n",
    "   - No assumptions ↔ Stronger conclusions\n",
    "   - Simple computation ↔ Better estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sample size matters**\n",
    "   - More data → more confidence\n",
    "   - Width decreases as O(1/√n)\n",
    "   - Need 4× data for 2× precision\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Context matters**\n",
    "   - Risk-averse decisions → use Hoeffding\n",
    "   - Precision matters → use CLT/Bootstrap\n",
    "   - Unknown distribution → use Hoeffding\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "When you run `problem3_main()`, you'll see:\n",
    "- ✅ Average cost per observation from test set\n",
    "- ✅ 95% confidence interval (likely including negative bound)\n",
    "- ✅ Interpretation of conservativeness\n",
