Explain geometrically what each row represents in the approximating matrix in terms of the original data, write your answer as free text in the Markdown cell below as instructed in the cells.\n",

    "**What is Explained Variance?**  \n",
    "Explained variance tells us what fraction of the data's total variability is captured when we use only the first $k$ principal components (singular vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "- Variance of component $i$ = $\\frac{\\sigma_i^2}{n-1}$ where $\\sigma_i$ is the $i$-th singular value\n",
    "- Total variance = $\\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\frac{\\sigma_i^2}{n-1}$\n",
    "- Explained variance with $k$ components = $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma_i^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\sigma_i^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:**\n",
    "- We need **9 components** to explain at least 90% of the variance\n",
    "- With 9 components: 94.47% variance explained\n",
    "- With 10 components: 99.91% variance explained (almost all!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** Most of the data's structure is captured in the first 9 dimensions. The remaining 91 dimensions contain mostly noise or less important patterns. This is dimension reduction in action!"

    "**Anomaly Detection using Reconstruction Error:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept:** Samples that are poorly reconstructed by the low-rank approximation are likely to be anomalies/outliers. They don't fit the main patterns captured by the principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method:**\n",
    "1. **Reconstruction Error**: For each sample, calculate the Euclidean distance between the original and its approximation:\n",
    "   $$\\text{error}_i = ||x_i - \\hat{x}_i||_2$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Empirical Distribution Function (EDF)**: The EDF shows the cumulative distribution of reconstruction errors. We can see that:\n",
    "   - Most samples have errors between 0 and 15\n",
    "   - A few samples have very high errors (up to 26.5)\n",
    "   - The EDF levels off around 90%, then slowly increases for the outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Threshold Selection**: We choose a threshold (18.76) such that exactly 10 samples are at or above it. These are the **anomalies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** The 10 outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the main patterns. They have structure in directions that aren't captured by the 9 principal components. This could be:\n",
    "- Measurement errors\n",
    "- Rare events\n",
    "- Data from a different distribution\n",
    "- Interesting edge cases worth investigating!"

    "\n",
    "#### Discussion on the value of the MARE\n",
    "\n",
    "**MARE = 0.577 (57.7%) - This is POOR performance!**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A \"good\" MARE for salary prediction should be below 0.20 (20%), ideally closer to 0.10\n",
    "- Our model's predictions are off by an average of 58% of the true salary\n",
    "- This level of error makes the model unreliable for practical use\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it so high?**\n",
    "- Linear models assume linear relationships, but salary likely has non-linear dependencies\n",
    "- The features may not capture enough information about salary determinants\n",
    "- The data might have high variance or outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discussion on the predicted vs. true scatterplot\n",
    "\n",
    "**Three major issues visible:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vertical Striping Pattern**: \n",
    "   - Predictions cluster at specific values (visible as vertical lines)\n",
    "   - Caused by discrete/categorical features with few unique values\n",
    "   - Especially `employment_type` which is almost always 1 (Full-time)\n",
    "   - Model can only output limited distinct salary predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Underprediction of High Salaries**:\n",
    "   - For true salaries > $250,000, predictions rarely exceed $200,000\n",
    "   - Model is biased toward predicting lower values\n",
    "   - Linear regression pulls toward the mean, missing extreme values\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Wide Scatter**:\n",
    "   - Large vertical spread at each predicted value\n",
    "   - Same prediction corresponds to vastly different true salaries\n",
    "   - Indicates high uncertainty and poor fit\n",
    "\n",
    "**If the model were good**: Points would cluster tightly along the diagonal line y = x\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall Assessment and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Model Performance: UNACCEPTABLE**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems Identified:**\n",
    "1. **Feature issues**:\n",
    "   - `work_year` is heavily concentrated in 2023 → little variation\n",
    "   - `employment_type` is almost all \"1\" → provides no information\n",
    "   - These features don't help the model learn\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Missing important features**:\n",
    "   - Job title/role\n",
    "   - Company size\n",
    "   - Geographic location/cost of living\n",
    "   - Industry/sector\n",
    "   - Education level\n",
    "   - Years of experience (not just level)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model limitations**:\n",
    "   - Linear regression too simple for this complex relationship\n",
    "   - Can't capture non-linear effects or interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended Improvements:**\n",
    "1. **Drop uninformative features**: Remove `work_year` and `employment_type`\n",
    "2. **Add meaningful features**: Include job title, location, company details\n",
    "3. **Feature engineering**: Create interaction terms, polynomial features\n",
    "4. **Try better models**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks\n",
    "5. **Handle outliers**: Remove or treat extreme salary values\n",
    "6. **Scale features**: Standardize features for better model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected outcome**: With these changes, MARE could drop to 0.15-0.25 range \n"

    "### Problem 3 Part 4 - EXPLANATION ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Starting at state A, what's the probability of being in state B after exactly 5 steps?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method:** Use the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation:\n",
    "$$P^{(5)}(A,B) = (P^5)_{AB}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P^5 = P \\times P \\times P \\times P \\times P$ is the 5-step transition matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computation:**\n",
    "We compute $P^5$ by multiplying the transition matrix by itself 5 times, then extract the entry corresponding to (A, B).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chain A:**\n",
    "- Start at A (index 0), want to reach B (index 1) in 5 steps\n",
    "- $P(X_5 = B | X_0 = A) = 0.2064$ **(20.64%)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** There's about a 21% chance of being at state B after 5 steps starting from A.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why relatively low?** \n",
    "- A has a strong self-loop (0.8 probability to stay)\n",
    "- Even when leaving A, must navigate through B → C → D paths\n",
    "- Many paths lead back to A or get stuck at D rather than B\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chain B:**\n",
    "- Start at A (index 0), want to reach B (index 1) in 5 steps\n",
    "- $P(X_5 = B | X_0 = A) = 0.872$ **(87.2%)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** There's an 87% chance of being at state B after 5 steps!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why so high?**\n",
    "Let's trace the most likely path:\n",
    "- A → D (prob 0.8) - most likely first step\n",
    "- From D: D → C (prob 0.5)\n",
    "- Now in the B-C absorbing cycle\n",
    "- After entering {B, C}, we alternate: C → B → C → B → C → B...\n",
    "- In 5 steps: if we're in the B-C cycle by step 2, we'll likely be at B at step 5\n",
    "\n",
    "**Path analysis:**\n",
    "- A → D → C → B → C → B (step 5 at B) ✓\n",
    "- A → B → C → B → C → B (step 5 at B) ✓\n",
    "- The fixed alternation in the B-C cycle means we're very likely at B after an odd number of steps from entering the cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Difference:**\n",
    "- **Chain A:** Connected graph with self-loops → probability spreads out\n",
    "- **Chain B:** Absorbing cycle in {B, C} → probability concentrates in the cycle, and the period-2 structure makes B highly likely at step 5"
