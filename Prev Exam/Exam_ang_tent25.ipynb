    "This exam has 3 problems for a total of 40 points, to pass you need\n",

    "## Some general hints and information:\n",
    "* Try to answer all questions even if you are uncertain.\n",
    "* Comment your code, so that if you get the wrong answer I can understand how you thought\n",
    "this can give you some points even though the code does not run.\n",
    "* Follow the instruction sheet rigorously.\n",
    "* This exam is partially autograded, but your code and your free text answers are manually graded anonymously.\n",
    "* If there are any questions, please ask the exam guards, they will escalate it to me if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for free text answers\n",
    "* Be VERY clear with your reasoning, there should be zero ambiguity in what you are referring to.\n",
    "* If you want to include math, you can write LaTeX in the Markdown cells, for instance `$f(x)=x^2$` will be rendered as $f(x)=x^2$ and `$$f(x) = x^2$$` will become an equation line, as follows\n",
    "$$f(x) = x^2$$\n",

Compute the Singular Value Decomposition, i.e. construct the three matrices $U$, $D$, $V$ such that if $X$ is the data matrix of shape `n_samples x n_dimensions` then $X = UDV^T$. Put the resulting matrices in their variables, check that the shapes align with the instructions in the code cell. Finally, extract the first right and left singular vectors and store those as 1-d arrays in the instructed variables. **Hint: make sure that the first right and left singular vectors are correct by using the matrix, also be careful about the shape!!**\n",

Calculate the explained variance of using $1$, $2$,... number of singular vectors and select the smallest number of singular vectors that is needed in order to explain at least $90\\%$ of the variance.\n",
    "3. [3p] With the number of components chosen in part 2, construct the best approximating matrix with the rank as the number of components. Explain geometrically what each row represents in the approximating matrix in terms of the original data, write your answer as free text in the Markdown cell below as instructed in the cells.\n",

[4p] Create a vector which corresponds to the row-wise (Euclidean) distance between the original matrix `problem1_data`and the approximating matrix `problem1_approximation` and plot the empirical distribution function of that distance. Based on the empirical distribution function choose a threshold such that 10 samples are above it and the rest below. Store the 10 samples in the instructed variable."

    "the mean absolute relative error was around 0.577... \n",
    "I think that's too high. I'd say that a \"good\" mare would be around maybe 0.00 to 0.25 since it supposed to fit the line but, should still be general.\n",

    "It's very.. interesting. If we had a \"good\" model, the predicted values would be closer to the orange (true) line. \n",
    "There is likely a large data gap between employees that make ALOT of money, and that's why the predicted values make a hard stop on the x-axis. \n",
    "The model is biased for employees that earn less, due to the skewedness of the training data most likely. \n",
    "To explain why there is vertical lines in the predicted values, I believe its because in salaries.csv, salary_in_usd is often divisibibe by 10. May explain the evenly-spaced jumps n the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discussion\n",
    "I'm suspecting that some of the features used aren't very related to predicting salary_in_usd. Also, work_year is extremely \"2023\" heavy, and employment_type is almost exclusively \"1\". So.. what's the point of having employment_type. \n",
    "So for the next time, i'd drop \"work_type\" and \"work_year\". \n",
    "Remote ratio and the other features seem to be varied enough. It would be interesting to see the plot for that. \n"
